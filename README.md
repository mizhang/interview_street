================

This folder contains my sample C++ codes for a few only programming challenges. 
The common theme is algorithm efficiency among those challenges.

1. Sodoku solver (in the folder of ./soduku).
        At every step of the game, it is aimed to solve algorithmically and to 
   avoid trial_and_error approach as much as possible.  That way, a high efficiency
   is achieved.  OOD is implemented.

2. Circle Summation problem solution ( in the folder of ./Circle_Summation).
        This is a challenge published on the interviewstreet.com.  Please read 
   the problem.doc file in the project folder for more details. Large numbers are 
   used in test cases, thus demanding high efficiency of the program.  Currently, 
   about 10% of online submissions are accepterd as successful solutions.

3. EQUATIONS problem solution ( in the folder of ./EQUATIONS).
        This is a challenge published on the interviewstreet.com.  Please read
   the problem.doc file in the project folder for more details.  Large numbers
   are used in test cases, thus demanding high efficiency of the program.  
   About 1/3 of online submissions are accepted as successful solutions.
